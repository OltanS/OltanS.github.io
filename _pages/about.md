Hi, my name is Oltan and I'm a 5th year Mechatronic Engineering/Computer Science student at UNSW.

I believe the purpose of technology and science is to improve our quality of life. To me, to make progress towards a higher quality of life, we must free people from the mundane tasks we have to perform to survive so we can focus on the more mentally engaging. Working towards this vision of humans-need-not-apply, I hope to use my background in Robotics, Control Systems and Neural Networks to work on automating the mundane parts of life; so we can focus on the things that really matter.

You can see some of the projects I worked on in [my portfolio]({% link _pages/portfolio.html %}).
