I worked as a part of a team to compare the effectiveness of various methods to enable the identification of the same cells in different frames of a video.
This required a great amount of pre-processing and coming up with novel quantification methods to compare the different methods/algorithms available.
This effort was greatly helped by the computer vision course I took at UNSW (COMP9517) for which I got a High Distinction grade.
