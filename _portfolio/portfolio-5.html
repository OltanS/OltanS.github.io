I worked in the backend part of a team which put together a recipe sharing website, which got us a mark of 90 for UNSW's Computer Science Capstone Project. 
This required a lot of self-directed learning, and I took charge of integrating the website with a database using SQLAlchemy on Python. 
The work also required a great deal of learning about REST, testing with Postman, how to do input verification on the information that was passed by the frontend.
The skills I developed also extended to the project management side of things, as the team had to write meaningful user stories and break the overall work down to 
chunks to split between sprints.

The repository for the project can be seen <a href="https://github.com/COMP3900-9900-Capstone-Project/capstoneproject-comp3900-h09a-howdy">here</a>.
