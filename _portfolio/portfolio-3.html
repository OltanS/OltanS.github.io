Ultrasounds are a widely used medical diagnostic tool, but many communities in the world have limited access to the expertise required to conduct an ultrasound.
This is why I focused my thesis on the topic of remote ultrasounds, and how to improve them. It was hypothesised that the combination of a commercially available haptic 
feedback system combined with a commercially available Robot would both improve the precision of remote ultrasounds and enable the technology to be more widespread.

This is a project in progress.
