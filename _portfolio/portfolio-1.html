Ultrasounds are a widely used medical diagnostic tool, but many communities in the world have limited access to the
expertise required to conduct an ultrasound.
To remedy this, I developed a software bridge between the Universal Robots UR5e and
the 3DSystems Touch, and successfully enabled teleoperation with haptic feedback with the purpose of enabling
sonographers to
conduct their work remotely. The code for the project can be seen <a
